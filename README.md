On a typical day in the United States, more than 50,000 traffic stops are made by police. These data have been recorded over the past 
decade and analysed by the Standford Open Policing Project team on whether police treat minority groups unfairly. You can find their 
published paper here (https://5harad.com/papers/traffic-stops.pdf) using the same set of data (https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/).

In this project, I will only work on the data from Illinois, which is the sixth most populous state of the United States. 
The reason being is that Illinois is one of the few states that contains data in every variable recorded by the Standford Open Policing 
Project team (the others are Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington) and provides a reasonable amount of data 
(~4.7 million rows) for a full comprehensive analysis. Please see an overview of the data here (https://github.com/5harad/openpolicing/blob/master/DATA-README.md)
